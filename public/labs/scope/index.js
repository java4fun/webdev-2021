/**
 * Scope Exercise
 *
 * Resist the urge to jump ahead and attempt to encapsulate or modularize this code...
 * Create functions and variables in the global scope... you should not need to write a single {} object
 *
 * Implement two functions that share access to the same variable(s)
 *
 * promptUserForName()
 *
 * - This function takes 0 arguments and returns nothing
 * - This will ask the user for input using the built-in `prompt` function
 *      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt
 * - The function should keep track of how many times it has been invoked
 * - After the 1st invokation, it should not prompt() the user for their name again
 *
 * getCurrentName()
 *
 * - This function takes 0 arguments
 * - It should use the built-in `alert` function to "echo" the latest name the user provided
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert
